This game system is for  Beamsaber (v0.55) by Austin Ramsay which can be found here - https://austin-ramsay.itch.io/beamsaber
Everything is based off the Blades in the Dark system from megastruktur - https://github.com/megastruktur/foundryvtt-blades-in-the-dark
Thanks to Grankless for the v9 compatibility update - https://github.com/grankless/foundryvtt-beamsaber
